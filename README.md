Hello there,this is Ken Moses am the author of this This is my Readme in it contains my HTML, CSS and Jquery in this it styling is done with both css and bootstrap,on this project we are working on delani studio where we are displaying services we offer.The 'What we do' icons when clicked should toggle between the respective description of each icon. The description should be centered aligned. The header should be in bold and centered also. This should be achieved by using jQuery. Create a Hover effect for the Portfolio sections such that on hover a white box appears with then name of the project inside. The project picture should still be visible in the background. This should be achieved using jQuery. Make the site responsive. Tell the user through a pop up that you have received their message and also thank them for contacting you . For example: ** johndoe we have received your message. Thank you fro reaching out to us. ** Use mail chimp API to track all the emails and messages from your users Host your website to github pagesthank you!
