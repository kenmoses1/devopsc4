      <h1>Birthday and Akan Name Generation</h1>
      <p>This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and
        then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.</p>
      <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day
        name'
        which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names</p>
